    <h1> Welcome to the Couscous Game! </h1>
    <p> This is a first prototype of our implementation of the famous Beer Game (rebranded "Couscous" Game in honor of our world-famous national dish!) </p>
    <p> The original Beer Game was created in the 1960s by a group of professors at MIT's Sloan School of Management. The game has been used since then in a variety of forms (paper and spreadsheet-based solutions, online and offline software, etc.) as an experiential learning tool in introductory Supply Chain and Operations Management courses, as well as Management Information Systems ones. It greatly helps in the explanation and illustration of fundamental supply chain concepts, most notably the so-called "Bullwhip Effect" in supply chains. </p>
    <p> Click on the dish below to start the game, and enjoy the experience :) </p>
	
	<p> <u>Note</u>: you might need to zoom out the window in order to have a complete view of the game's canvas. Also, make sure your browser allows popups from the game. Finally, the game has only be tested on Google Chrome, and I do not guarantee that it displays and works correctly on other browsers (Firefox, Safari, etc.); this is after all a prototype developed by a single person (me) on a part-time basis :) </p>
