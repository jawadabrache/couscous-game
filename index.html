    <h1> Welcome to the Couscous Game! </h1>
    <p> This is a first prototype of our implementation of the famous Beer Game (renamed "Couscous" game in honor of our national dish.) </p>
    <p> The original beer game was created in the 1960s by a group of professors at MIT's Sloan School of Management. The game has been used since then as an experiential learning tool in introductory SCM and OM courses, notably to ilustrate the Bullwhip Effect concept in supply chains. </p>
    <p> Click on the dish below to start the game! We hope you enjoy your meal :) </p>
