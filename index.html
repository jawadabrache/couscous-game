    <h1> Welcome to the Couscous Game! </h1>
    <p> This is a first prototype of our implementation of the famous Beer Game (rebranded "Couscous" Game in honor of our world-famous national dish!) </p>
    <p> The original Beer Game was created in the 1960s by a group of professors at MIT's Sloan School of Management. The game has been used since then in a variety of forms (paper and spreadsheet-based solutions, online and offline software, etc.) as an experiential learning tool in introductory Supply Chain and Operations Management courses, as well as Management Information Systems ones. It greatly helps in the explanation and illustration of fundamental supply chain concepts, most notably the so-called "Bullwhip Effect" in supply chains. </p>
    <p> Click on the dish below to start the game, and enjoy the experience!  </p>

	<p> A brief overview of the game settings and assumption, and a succinct user's manual is available <a href="manual.html"> here</a> and may be consulted before playing the game.</p>
	
	
	<p> <u>Note</u>: 
	
	<ul>
		<li>You will need the Admin's password to run the game at full potential (for example as an instructor in a classroom environment.) Please send me a request by email to jawad.abrache AT gmail.com and I will be happy to send you the password. Please allow for a few days as I do not consult my email box daily.</li>
		<li>You might need to zoom out the window in order to have a complete view of the game's canvas. Also, make sure your browser allows popups from the game.</li>
		<li>As a bonus, the game embeds a classical music quiz to keep the players' attention, motivation, and spirits high. If classical music is not your cup of tea, please accept our apologies and deactivate music before playing the game (this is now possible :)</li>
		<li>Last but not least, the game has been tested (reasonably) on Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari only, and I do not guarantee that it will display and work correctly on other browsers (Opera, etc.); this is after all a prototype developed by a single person (me) on a part-time basis! There are certainly a few bugs lying there and I am counting on your feedback to catch them.</li>
